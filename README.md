# Wallmart Copycat


Initially, this project was supposed to be a calendar app that adds an auto increment feature for the spacing. However, I can't do a calendar app during the time when I was thinking of this so I gave up on that idea. Back then, I can't make a for loop that creates a sequence like 1+3+5+7.... So I decided to stick with a 1+3+3+3.... method. Also, the chrono library from C++ gave me a huge headache and this link fixed it. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36751133/proper-method-of-using-stdchrono). This was the very first time I was exposed to data structures and algorithms because of how strings and arrays are supposed to be managed on this project. Initially, I was copying code from GeeksforGeeks DSA problems about arrays that only reads the first few index and dismisses the rest until I gave up and started asking AI for help. Can't do it alone as a beginner. Also this time, I thought that AI will replace software engineers, but the more I progress and the more languages and libraries I learned, I realized that they can't. They might help yes, but they are only powerful for beginner level projects. I can guarantee you, try making complex projects using AI and it will destroy your code. It destroyed my code for C# desktop apps projects and my code whenever I try practicing Cython that I decided to just avoid it and I ended up going back to relying on google answers. I will only fear AI once it can finally solve a DSA and a CP problem. Can't even do a basic CSES problem.
